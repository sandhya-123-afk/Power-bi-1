Excited to share my end-to-end Power BI project focused on hospital performance analytics.

In this project, I designed an interactive dashboard using real-world healthcare data to analyze patients, departments, doctors, and billing insights.

# Key Highlights:

Built a star schema data model using Patient, Billing, and Department tables

Created interactive Power BI dashboards with slicers, drill-downs, and tooltips

#Developed DAX measures for KPIs such as:

Total Patients

Total Revenue

Average Bill per Patient

Average Length of Stay

#Analyzed:

Department-wise and doctor-wise performance

Revenue and cost breakdown (treatment, medicine, room charges)

Patient demographics (age, gender, pediatric vs adult)

Designed executive-level visuals for data-driven decision making

# Tools & Skills Used:

Power BI

DAX

Data Modeling

Data Visualization & Storytelling

# Business Value:

This dashboard helps hospital management identify high-performing departments and doctors, understand cost drivers, and improve operational efficiency.

This project strengthened my skills in Power BI reporting, DAX calculations, and dashboard design aligned with real business scenarios.
